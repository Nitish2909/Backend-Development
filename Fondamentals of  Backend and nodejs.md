# what is Backend and client server Architecture ?
<b>Client(Frontend)</b>
<br>
A client is a computer or software that requests services, resources, or data from a server over a network. It interacts or communicate  with the server by sending requests and receiving responses, typically through a web browser, application, or other interface.
<br>
<b>Example:</b>web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari are common client applications that request data from a server to render web pages.
<br>

<b>Server(backend)</b>
<br>
A Server, on the other hand, is a remote computer or system that provides data, resources or services to clients. It listens to incoming client requests, processes them and sends the required information or (response) back. A server can handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
